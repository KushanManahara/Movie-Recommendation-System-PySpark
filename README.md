# üé¨ PySpark Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using PySpark, leveraging collaborative filtering with ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm. The system processes a dataset of movie ratings, trains a recommendation model, and provides personalized movie recommendations to users.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Loading:** Loads movie ratings dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocesses the dataset by indexing movie titles and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Model Training:** Trains a recommendation model using the ALS algorithm.
- **Prediction:** Makes predictions on the test dataset to evaluate model performance.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
- **Recommendation:** Provides top movie recommendations to users based on their preferences.

## üíª Installation

To run the PySpark Movie Recommendation System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git```


2. Install the required dependencies:
`pip install pyspark`



## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get started with the PySpark Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Load the movie ratings dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset by indexing movie titles.
3. Split the dataset into training and test sets.
4. Train the recommendation model using the ALS algorithm.
5. Evaluate the model performance using RMSE.
6. Provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## üöÄ Usage

To use the PySpark Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your movie ratings dataset in CSV format.
2. Replace the path to your dataset in the `main.py` file:

```python
df = spark.read.csv('path/to/your/dataset.csv', inferSchema=True, header=True)
```

3. Ensure that your dataset contains columns for userId, title, and rating.

4. Run the main script to execute the recommendation system:


`python main.py`

5. The system will process the dataset, train the recommendation model, evaluate its performance, and provide personalized movie recommendations.

6. Access the recommendations through the console output or any other preferred method of displaying the results.



## üìö Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of the PySpark Movie Recommendation System, several key lessons were learned and challenges were encountered:

### Data Processing with PySpark

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handling large-scale datasets efficiently using PySpark required understanding data loading techniques and preprocessing steps such as indexing and splitting into training and test sets.
